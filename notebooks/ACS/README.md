# acs-notebook

This repository contains downloadable versions of several *HST*/ACS webpages with basic Python examples. These code examples are simple and only designed for a limited scope.

Users who need help transitioning from IRAF/PyRAF to Python should see the [stak-notebooks](https://github.com/spacetelescope/stak-notebooks) repository. 

For examples of workflows with *HST* data, please see the CSI notebooks repository (coming soon).
