    "\n",
    "This notebook contains several examples of how to use the `synphot` and `stsynphot` modules for various photometric purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "`synphot` is a Python module that facilitates synthetic photometry, which has an extension module called `stsynphot` to add support for STScI missions. `synphot` is meant to be a replacement for AstroLib `pysynphot`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples 1, 2, and 3 are based on those found in Section 9.1.10 of the 2018 version of the WFC3 Data Handbook. \n",
    "\n",
    "`stsynphot` requires access to data distributed by the [Calibration Data Reference System](https://hst-crds.stsci.edu/) (CRDS) in order to operate. Both packages look for an environment variable called `PYSYN_CDBS` to find the directory containing these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can obtain these data files from the CDRS. Information on how to obtain the most up-to-date reference files (and what they contain) can be found [here](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/reference-data-for-calibration-and-tools/synphot-throughput-tables). An example of how to download the files with `curl` and set up this environment variable is presented below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed instructions on how to install and set up these packages, see the [synphot](https://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation-and-setup) and [stsynphot](https://stsynphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation-and-setup) documentation."

    "### 2.1 Setting up bandpasses <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"band\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the examples below require us to define a bandpass. Bandpasses are defined in `stsynphot` using a string of comma-separated keywords that represents a particular observation mode (obsmode). For WFC3, an obsmode string will, at minimum, look something like: `\"wfc3, [detector], [filter]\"`. E.g. `\"wfc3, uvis1, f606w\"` will get you the bandpass for the F606W filter on WFC3's UVIS1 detector. One may also specify an aperture size in arcseconds with `aper#value` and a Modified Julian Date (to account for time-dependent changes in the UVIS detector sensitivity) with `mjd#value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation [here](https://stsynphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stsynphot/obsmode.html) provides a further overview of how to construct an observation mode, and includes a link to the full set of available obsmode keywords.\n",

    "- Specifying WFC3 bandpasses in `stsynphot` and define spectra with `synphot`.\n",
    "- Computing inverse sensitivity values an encircled energy corrections for the WFC3 chips.\n",
    "- Renormalizing spectra in one filter and predicting an effective stimulus in another filter.\n",
    "- Finding the color term between two bandpasses.\n",
    "- Finding a UV color term for two different spectral types, across the two UVIS chips.\n",
    "- Plotting bandpasses and spectra.\n",
