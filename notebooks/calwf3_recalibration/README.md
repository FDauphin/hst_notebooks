A new Jupyter notebook provides `calwf3` reprocessing examples to improve calibrated WFC3/IR
images affected by time-variable background. The notebook shows how to diagnose images with
poor-quality ramp fits and rerun `calwf3` with the 'CRCORR' step turned off. This method is
described as the 'Last-minus-first' technique WFC3 ISR 2016-16.
